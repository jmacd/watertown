# Rotating log-file ingestion

## Overview

`logfile-ingest` reads rotating host log files and stores raw series in a writable pond. Archived files are immutable inputs; the active file is append-only.

## Example configuration

{{ source path="default.yaml" language="yaml" /}}

For OTLP JSON, set `timestamp_field: timeUnixNano` and
`timestamp_unit: nanoseconds` together. Supported units are listed below.

## Use and behavior

Install with `pond mknod logfile-ingest /etc/logs --config-path logs.yaml`, then run `pond run /etc/logs -- push` (the default operation). `b3sum` reports source checksums; `pull` does nothing.

Timestamp extraction searches recursively for the configured JSON key and records outward-rounded microsecond bounds. Without bounds, downstream temporal reduction may recompute full history. Raw log bytes do not imply one Arrow schema; query them through an appropriate format URL.
